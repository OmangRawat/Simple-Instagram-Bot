# Selenium based Instagram Bot using Chrome Web Driver
(Selenium: Python Web-Automation Library)



# Requirements to use the Bot:
1.) You should have the right Chrome Web Driver installed (based on the Chrome Version you are using)
      Why?? -> Thats what is used to get through the security against bots of the browser 
2.) And if the program throws error you need to recheck the autoclicks
      Why?? -> Because Instagram keeps changing their basic framework to add new features so the automation apps also need to be updated as per its updates regularly


Web Automation is fun and can be used to do a lot of things that make repetetive things less pain.

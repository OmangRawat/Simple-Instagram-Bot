Selenium based Instagram Bot using Chrome Web Driver <br />
(Selenium: Python Web-Automation Library)   <br />



Requirements to use the Bot: <br />
1.) You should have the right Chrome Web Driver installed (based on the Chrome Version you are using) <br />
      Why?? -> Thats what is used to get through the security against bots of the browser <br /> <br />
2.) And if the program throws error you need to recheck the autoclicks <br />
      Why?? -> Because Instagram keeps changing their basic framework to add new features so the automation apps also need to be updated as per its updates regularly <br />
<br />
<br />
Web Automation is fun and can be used to do a lot of things that make repetetive things less pain.
